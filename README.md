MacRume
===
The macOS app for Rume (Rust + Rime). [Rume](https://github.com/igncp/rume) is
a fork of [librime](https://github.com/rime/librime), and this project is a
fork of [Squirrel](https://github.com/rime/squirrel), the Rime macOS app. I
created this fork to practice Rust (and C++) programming, and learn the details
about an IME implementation. The intention is to add some QoL improvements and
keep in sync with the upstream. All credits go to the original authors.

## Development

- `make bootstrap`: Installs all dependencies post-clone
- `make install-package`: Packages and installs the application locally
