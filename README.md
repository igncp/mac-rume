MacRume
===
The macOS app for Rume (Rust + Rime). Rume is a fork of librime, and this
project is a fork of Squirrel (the Rime macOS app) to practice Rust (and C++)
programming and learn the details about an IME implementation. The intention is
to add some QoL improvements and keep in sync with the upstream. All credits go
to the original authors.
